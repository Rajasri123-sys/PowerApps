Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. With Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in many online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on). Apps built with Power Apps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes. What's more, apps built with Power Apps have a responsive design and can run seamlessly in browser and on mobile devices (phone or tablet). Power Apps "democratizes" the business-app-building experience by enabling users to create feature-rich, custom business apps without writing code. Power Apps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and metadata, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data 

Overview of creating apps in Power Apps
Power Apps is a high-productivity development platform for business apps. It has these major
components:
Plans
Copilot
Canvas apps
Model-driven apps
Microsoft Dataverse

Canvas apps
Canvas apps start with your user experience. You craft a highly tailored interface with the power of a blank canvas and connect it to your choice of more than 200 data sources. You can build canvas apps for web, mobile, and tablet applications. Canvas apps give you the flexibility to arrange the user experience and interface the way you want it. Let your creativity and business sense guide how you want your apps to look and feel.
You can start to build your app from Microsoft tools where your data lives, such as:
From a SharePoint list
From a Power BI dashboard
Creating a canvas app is easy. With Power Apps, you can find or create your app in several
ways:
From a Dataverse source
From data in a SharePoint List
From Excel data
From a blank canvas
Via AppSource
In addition to creating apps in Power Apps, you can also create apps directly within Microsoft Teams by using Power Apps. For more information, see Create apps in Microsoft Teams by using Power Apps

Model-driven apps
Model-driven apps start with your data model. You build up from the shape of your core
business data and processes in the Dataverse to model forms, views, and other components.
Model-driven apps automatically generate a great UI that's responsive across devices.
When you create a model-driven app, you can use all the power of the Dataverse to rapidly
configure your forms, business rules, and process flows. You create a model-driven app from
the Power Apps site.
As part of the custom page public preview, you can add the new page type based on canvas
into a new or existing model-driven app. This addition brings the power and flexibility of a
canvas experience within the model-driven app. Custom pages allow
Full control over page layout
Out of box controls and custom components
Power Apps connectors
Low-code authoring

Dataverse
Dataverse is the data platform that comes with Power Apps and allows you to store and model
business data. It's the platform on which Dynamics 365 apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales,
Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, and Project Service Automation) are built. If you're
a Dynamics 365 customer, your data is already in Dataverse.
Dataverse allows you to securely store and manage data within a set of standard and custom
tables. You can add columns to those tables when you need them.

Note
Every member in an organization can use 
the default environment. Like any
environment, users can see apps where they have enough privileges to use an app.
All users with the Environment Maker security role in an environment can see all
model-driven apps in that environment, including the default environment. More
information: 
Model-driven app privileges to view and access apps.
When you create an app in one environment, you can't see it from another
environment. People who want to run your app need access to the environment
where you created it.

Can I work in Power Apps in both my home tenant and a resource
tenant?
Yes, but only in separate browser sessions. For example, Microsoft Edge can be open in its
standard mode, and you can start a separate session in a new InPrivate window.
If you open multiple tabs in the same browser session, only resources in the most recently
signed-in tenant are accessible.

Add an app to Microsoft Teams
Microsoft Teams is a chat-based collaboration platform built on Office 365 technologies.You can customize the Teams experience by adding Power Apps canvas apps to your channels in Teams.

A model-driven app has multiple components including dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes that make the app easy to use. Model-driven apps can also include AI features that let users to supervise and interact with agents around business processes more efficiently and productively
What's included with the modern, refreshed look
Here's what you can expect in the modern, refreshed experience:
Updated styling in form, view, and dashboard pages, which includes the use of drop
shadows and brighter background colors to create an elevated or floating appearance.
The floating appearance helps to visually separate sections and focuses attention on
primary content.
New Fluent-based controls in forms, business process flows, and dialogs. Dialogs now
resize height automatically based on the content.
A new Power Apps grid in place of the read-only grid in view and standard, dashboard
pages.
A new mechanism for customizing the app header colors to match your personal or
organizational branding. Learn more in Use modern themes.
An end user setting called Try the new look that turns on the modern, refreshed
experience
Command bar:
The floating command bar aligns with the Microsoft 365 experience, with consistent spacing, rounded corners, and elevation. 
View Pages:
View pages use the new command bar and with updated grid areas that take advantage of the elevation changes to help draw the user's attention.The most significant change on view pages is the switch from the read-only grid to the PowerApps grid control, which features infinite scrolling for a modern, data browsing experience. This grid also appears in subgrids and associated grids in main forms and dashboards. The Power Apps grid control also supports inline editing using the Enable filtering property. Makers can manually configure their editable grids to use the Power Apps grid control.
Form Pages:
Form pages use the new command bar with refreshed headers, tabs, sections, and business process flows. Quick views, card forms, headers, sitemaps, and timeline controls also feature updating styling.
